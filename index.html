        <p class="title"> A look at LGBT civil rights over the last half-century of state legislation changes. Documenting laws and regulations that both restrict and promote LGBT rights.</p>
        </div>
		<p>Over the last fifty years, there has been a marked increase in the sheer quantity of state legislation that deals with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender rights. The Supreme Court has recently heard two LGBT cases, Prop 8 and DOMA, and are expected to announce their decisions in June of 2013.  These cases will have a significant impact on both state and federal laws. Leading up to these decisions, it is worth taking a look at how state LGBT laws dealing with marriage, adoption, housing, hate crimes, hospital visitation, and employment have changed over the last half-century. <a href="#footer">Read more about this map.</a></p>       
		<!-- <p>We conceptualized mapping this data once the Supreme Court started hearing the Prop 8 and Defense of Marriage Act. Our motivation stems from general interest, it is fascinating how LGBT rights have been developing exponentially in the United States in the last decade, and the personal stake that we have in the outcomes of the rulings as we either belong to the LGBT community ourselves or are close to those that identify as queer. It is exciting for us in that in the month of May alone we had to update our data three times as new states adopted laws for marriage equality. As legislation is moving so quickly now, it is important to look back and see that this was not always the case. LGBT rights have been restricted, gained traction, and been left stagnant over the years, all at varying speeds. We look forward to you exploring these trends throughout the fight for equal rights.

                  Laws that restrict or permit same sex partners to visit one another in the hospital. New regulations were enacted under President Obama's administration in 2011 that required Medicare or Medicaid accepting-hospitals to allow patients to choose who may have visitation rights, as well as who can make medical decisions on their behalf. In these cases, patients cannot be discriminated against based on sexual orientation or gender identity.</dd>

        <h1 class="intro">About This Map</h1><p>"Fifty Years of Change" documents the laws the United States has passed in the half-century that both restrict and extend LGBT rights. Over the last fifty years, there has been a marked increase in the sheer quantity of legislation that deals with LGBT rights. The spikes in the number of LGBT-related laws are sometimes grouped in time by the fact that they restrict rights for LGBT individuals, while at other times the spikes consist mostly of laws that protect and extend LBGT rights. </p> 
<p>
By looking at LBGT rights through time one cannot deny that a fundamental conversation is currently underway in our country, and has been exponentially growing to this point. So why document the last fifty years now? The Supreme Court has recently heard two cases, Prop 8 and DOMA, and are expected to announce their decisions on these cases in early June of 2013.  These cases will have a significant impact on both state and federal laws, so we believe it is  important to review our nation's journey to this critical juncture for LGBT civil rights.</p>
